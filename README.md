### Gameplay: 
The player is free to move in any direction he wants in space, in the proximity of a lot of asteroids that will block the path of the player. Each stage ,he has to strike down as many spaceships as possible using his laser gun.When the player advances a stage , his attack speed also increases. In total, he has 8 HP, witch gradually regenerates after a amount of time, so the player does not need to be concerned about losing some hit points from here and there.

### Characters: 
The Main Ship (the player) needs to annihilate all the threats and advance as many levels as possible, without getting exterminated by the enemy spaceships
The Unknown Spaceships will chase down the player and try to eliminate him.

### Mechanics: 
The movement of the ship can be done by using the arrow keys and the mouse.You also aim using the mouse. To fire the player must press left click. If the player manages destroy all the enemies, he will get to the next phase of the game instantly (which involves new enemy ships to come after the player), but his HP won’t reset, meaning he is exposed to a higher risk, if his position is not in his favor. In case the player gets hit by projectiles, he will be knocked back a bit too. The player can also press Space to slow down. However, if the player’s ship gets destroyed, he can choose whether he wants to play the game once again, by pressing ‘R’ button, or, if he chooses to quit, he can do it so by pressing ‘X’.Every time the player destroys a ship, he receives an point in his score. The game also saves the player’s best score.
